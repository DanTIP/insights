# Insights Frontend Task
## Background

This app was made using React. I approached the task with a view to create some intersting masonry. 

I completed this project as part of a tech test, but were I to continue work on it I would:
  - Improve the layout on  mobile devices, as though it is responsive it doesn't always look particularly pretty. 
  - Add some animations where the blocks expand and contract independently when not interracted with for a certain period of time (just because I think that would look neat).
  - Spend more time focusing on the imagery.
  - Perhaps make the entire masonry grid smaller to one day use as a template in other projects.
